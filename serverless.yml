# Lambda function definitions. Each function defines itself in a separate YAML
# file that resides alongside the function implementation. Unfortunately we have
# to duplicate the function name here due to the way Serverless YAML importing
# and parsing works (in an ideal world we could include these in a list as we do
# for resources).
